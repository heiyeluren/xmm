### Example 1: A quick introduction to using XMM

XMM is very simple and easy to use, so let's look at it directly in code.

Example 1: See a quick start example of a simple common variable stored using XMM

- [XMM Usage - Getting Started](https://github.com/heiyeluren/XMM/blob/main/example/xmm-test00.go)

<br />

### Example 2: How to use XMM in a structure

Illustration: A slightly more complex application of how to use XMM in a structure for requesting and releasing memory
operations.

### Example 3: Constructing a linked table using XMM

Description: Build some complex data structure applications with XMM, constructing a single linked table structure using

<br />

### Example 4: Building a hash table with XMM

Description: Build some complex data structure applications with XMM, build a hash table data structure to use, you can
carefully refer to see if it helps you to use XMM

### XMM Technology Exchange Community

XMM is currently an early version, the overall performance is relatively good, and is also currently used in another
self-developed XMap module, of course, there are also some problems and bugs, welcome everyone to create together, you
